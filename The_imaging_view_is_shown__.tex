The imaging view is shown in figure \ref{fig:imagingview}. The left-side column includes a section to mark an image as "Pass", "Fail", "Edited", and "Needs Edits" and provide notes. The status bar at the top-left portion updates instantaneously, with information on which user checked the image, the quality status of the image, and when it was last checked. Users are also able to assign edits on other users on the system, for example, if the image needs to be edited by someone else. On the right hand side, the papaya.js viewer (\href{http://rii-mango.github.io/Papaya/}{http://rii-mango.github.io/Papaya/} was used to display the nifti volumes of data and segmentations.
