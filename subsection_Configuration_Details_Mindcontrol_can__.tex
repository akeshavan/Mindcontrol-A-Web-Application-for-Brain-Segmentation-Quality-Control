\subsection{Configuration Details}

Mindcontrol can be configured for a study's specific needs be specifying a configuration JSON file. The configuration file describes processing modules by module names, the columns to display in the data table below, and the type of graph to display (Date histogram or 1D histogram). Images must be hosted on a separate server or a content delivery network (CDN) and the Mindcontrol database populated with URLs to these images. An initial JSON file can be specified to populate the Mindcontrol MongoDB with entries on startup if the database is empty. Instructions and example JSON schema for the configuration file and the database entries can be found at \url{https://github.com/akeshavan/mindcontrol/wiki} along with a Python function to access the MongoDB, which can be used to write custom editing scripts and externally update the database.
