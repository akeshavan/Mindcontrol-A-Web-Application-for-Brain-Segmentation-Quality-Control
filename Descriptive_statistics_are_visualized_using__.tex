Descriptive statistics are visualized using the D3 library (\href{https://d3js.org/}{https://d3js.org/}). Currently, two visualizations are provided: a histogram of calendar dates that shows the number of exams collected on a given day and 1D histograms with dimensions that are swappable using a dropdown menu, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dashboard}. Both histogram plots interactively filter the data tables below. Clicking on a particular date on the date-histogram plot filters all tables by the exams collected on that particular date. Users are able to ``brush'' sections of the histogram to filter all tables with exams that meet requirements of values within that range.
