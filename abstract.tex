Mindcontrol is an open-source web application for the collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing outputs. Mindcontrol consists of a dashboard to organize data, descriptive statistic visualizations to explore data, an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is flexible, and can be configured for the outputs of any software package in any data organization structure. Example configurations for three large, open-source datasets are presented here - the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection.
