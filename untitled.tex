The imaging biomarkers derived from MRI play a crucial role in the fields of neuroscience, neurology and psychiatry. Estimates of regional brain volumes and shape features help track the disease progression of several neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease \cite{Vemuri_2010}, Parkinson's disease \cite{Silvia_Mangia_2013}, schizophrenia\cite{shenton2001review}, depression\cite{meisenzahl2011structural}, autism\cite{brambilla2003brain}, and multiple sclerosis\cite{Filippi_1995}, to name a few. Assuring the quality of these biomarkers is crucial, especially with increases in data collection to accommodate precision medicine approaches. 

%Neuroimaging has also helped to understand cognitive development, from childhood, through adolescence\cite{giedd2010structural}, adulthood and senescence.
