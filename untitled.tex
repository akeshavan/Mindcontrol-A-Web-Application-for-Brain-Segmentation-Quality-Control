The imaging biomarkers derived from MRI play a crucial role in the fields of neuroscience, neurology and psychiatry. Estimates of regional brain volumes and shape features play an important role in tracking the disease progression of several neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease \cite{Vemuri_2010}, Parkinson's disease \cite{Silvia_Mangia_2013}, schizophrenia\cite{shenton2001review}, depression\cite{meisenzahl2011structural}, autism\cite{brambilla2003brain}, and multiple sclerosis\cite{Filippi_1995}, to name a few. As the amount of data grows to accommodate precision medicine approaches, assuring biomarker quality is an crucial for the field neuroimaging. 

%Neuroimaging has also helped to understand cognitive development, from childhood, through adolescence\cite{giedd2010structural}, adulthood and senescence.
