\section{Background}


The imaging biomarkers derived from MRI play a crucial role in the fields of neuroscience, neurology and psychiatry. Estimates of regional brain volumes and shape features help track the disease progression of several neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease \cite{Vemuri_2010}, Parkinson's disease \cite{Silvia_Mangia_2013}, schizophrenia\cite{shenton2001review}, depression\cite{meisenzahl2011structural}, autism\cite{brambilla2003brain}, and multiple sclerosis\cite{Filippi_1995}, to name a few. Assuring the quality of these biomarkers is crucial as we scale their production, given recent increases in data collection to accommodate modern precision medicine approaches. 

Errors in regional segmentation stem from multiple sources. First, the quality of the MRI scan itself due to motion artifacts or scanner instabilities could blur and distort anatomical boundaries \cite{Blumenthal_2002}. Differences in MRI hardware, software, and acquisition sequences also contribute to contrast differences and gradient distortions that affect tissue classification, which makes combining datasets across sites challenging \cite{keshavan2016power}. An additional source of error comes from parameter selection for segmentation algorithms, where varying parameter choices give different results \cite{Han_2006}. Furthermore, if MR segmentation algorithms were developed and tested on healthy adult brains, using the algorithm on brain images of children, the elderly, or those with pathology, may violate certain assumptions of the algorithm, resulting in drastically different results. 

Several quality assurance strategies exist to address these segmentation errors. All of the errors mentioned above could be flagged before analysis by first ensuring data quality before the pipeline by simply viewing the segmentations, with the included viewers of the software packages that the segmentations come from, like freeview and fslview. Because this gets too time consuming for large datasets, entire pipelines have been developed, like the QAP protocol, to produce summary statistics to describe the quality of the raw data going into the algorithm. Another quality assurance strategy is to plot distributions of the output metrics themselves and remove any outliers. This gets dangerous for pathological brains those outliers may be valid segmentations, and you miss out on an important data point, which is why looking at actual images is so important. Ideally, a link would exist between scalar summary statistics and 3D/4D volumes. Such a link would allow researchers to prioritize which images to QC, how to collaborate and organize on quality checking images, and help us understand how scalar quality metrics, such as SNR, CNR, relate to the actual image and segmentation. In this report, we propose a collaborative and efficient MRI quality control solution that links group-level descriptive statistics with individual volume views of MRI images.  

We propose an open source web-based brain quality control application called Mindcontrol, which is a dashboard to organize, quality control, annotate, edit, and collaborate on neuroimaging processing results. Mindcontrol provides an easy-to-use interface for examining distributions of descriptive measures from neuroimaging pipelines (e.g., surface area of right insula), and viewing the results of segmentation analyses using the Papaya volume viewer (https://github.com/rii-mango/Papaya). Users are able to annotate points and curves on the volume, edit voxels, and assign tasks to other users (e.g., to correct the segmentation of a particular image). The platform is pipeline agnostic, meaning that it can be configured to quality control any set of 3D volumes regardless of what neuroimaging software package produced it. In the following sections, we describe the implementation details of Mindcontrol, as well as its configuration to three different open-source datasets, with three different types of neuroimaging pipeline outputs. 

%Neuroimaging has also helped to understand cognitive development, from childhood, through adolescence\cite{giedd2010structural}, adulthood and senescence.
