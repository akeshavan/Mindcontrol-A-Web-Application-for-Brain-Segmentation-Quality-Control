\section{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mindcontrol is a configurable neuroinformatics dashboard that links information visualization, descriptive stats, with scientific data visualization, MRI images and their overlays (segmentation or otherwise). The 3 demo configurations in this paper demonstrate the link between MRI quality metrics and raw data, the link between Freesurfer regional volumes and segmentation quality, and the link between antsCortical Thickness summary statistics and segmentation/thickness estimates on the volume. The platform is configurable, open-source, and software/pipeline agnostic, meaning that any researcher can configure it to their specific analysis outputs. The dashboard allows researchers to assign editing tasks to others, who can then perform edits on the app itself. 
\item There have been considerable efforts in this field to ensure data quality on a large scale. The human connectome project's extensive informatics pipeline, which includes a database service, quality control procedures, and a data visualization platform, have been key to the project's success in collecting a large, high quality dataset \cite{Marcus_2013}. The Allen Brain Atlas offers a comprehensive genetic, neuroanatomical and connectivity data exploration portal, linking an MRI viewer with data tables \cite{Sunkin_2012}.  %LORIS probably has something
\item FSL has a thing for each output
\item Freesurfer has a pretty involved thing
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Useful for:
    \item Freesurfer editing
    \item fMRI pipeline intermediates
    \item Checking a huge amount of files w/ lots of people
    \end{itemize}
