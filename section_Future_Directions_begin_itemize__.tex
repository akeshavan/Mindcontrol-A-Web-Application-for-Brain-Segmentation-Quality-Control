\section{Future Directions}

Mindcontrol is being actively developed with new features. New information visualizations to detect outliers are being developed, in the form of scatter plots to compare two metrics against each other, and a longitudinal view for the trajectory of single subject for a given metric. New scientific data visualizations are planned, by using using the BrainBrowser library \cite{Sherif_2015} to display cortical surfaces. There is a beta version of real-time collaborative annotations, where two users can annotate the same image and see the edits of the other as they occur. 

Currently, configuring Mindcontrol involves creating a JSON file to describe the different modules and another JSON file to populate the Mongo database with pointers to images and their scalar metrics. In the future, this process could be streamlined by creating a Mindcontrol configuration for datasets with a standardized folder structure, like the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) \cite{Gorgolewski_2016} and their derivatives \cite{gorgolewski2016bids}.
