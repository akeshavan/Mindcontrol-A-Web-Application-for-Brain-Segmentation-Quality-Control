\section{Examples/Applications}

Mindcontrol configurations were developed for selected data from the 1000 Functional Connectomes project (FCP), the consortium for reliability and reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection I. 

The FCP consists of 1414 resting state fMRI and corresponding structural datasets collected from 35 sites around the world  \cite{biswal2010toward}, which have been openly shared with the public. The purpose of the FCP collaboration is to comprehensively map the functional human connectome, to understand genetic influences on brain's structure and function, and to understand how brain structure and function relate to human behavior \cite{biswal2010toward}. Segmentation of 200 selected FCP anatomical images from Baltimore, Bangor, Berlin, ICBM, and Milwaukee was performed with Freesurfer (recon-all) version 5.3.0 \cite{fischl2002whole} using the RedHat 7 operating system on IEEE 754 compliant hardware at UCSF. Regional volumes of  subcortical and cerebellar regions were computed. Cortical volumes, areas, and thicknesses were also computed and averaged across hemispheres. Scan dates were simulated in order to demonstrate the date histogram shown in Figure \ref{fig:appstructure}B. The original anonymized T1-weighted images, along with the aparc+aseg output from Freesurfer, were converted to the compressed NifTI (.nii.gz) format and uploaded to Dropbox for the purpose of visualization within Mindcontrol. The Mindcontrol database was populated with URLs to these images, along with their corresponding FreeSurfer segmentation metrics. The demo of the FCP data is located at \url{http://mindcontrol.herokuapp.com}. 

More recently, researchers have developed the Preprocessed-Connectomes Project's Quality Assurance Protocol (PCP-QAP) software, to provide anatomical and functional data quality measures in order to detect low-quality images before data processing and analysis \cite{shehzadpreprocessed}. Some metrics include contrast-to-noise ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, voxel smoothness, percentage of artifact voxels, foreground-to-background energy ratio, and entropy focus criterion \cite{shehzadpreprocessed}. The PCP-QAP protocol has been run on the  Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) datasets and the results have been posted online. 

The purpose of CoRR is to provide an open-science dataset to assess the reliability of functional and structural connectomics by defining test-retest reliability of commonly used MR metrics; to understand the variability of these metrics across sites; and to establish a standard benchmark dataset on which to evaluate new imaging metrics \cite{Zuo_2014}. PCP-QAP normative data for the CoRR study was downloaded from \href{http://raw.githubusercontent.com/preprocessed-connectomes-project/quality-assessment-protocol/master/poster_data/corr_anat.csv}{https://github.com/preprocessed-connectomes-project/quality-assessment-protocol}. The Mindcontrol database was populated with pointers to 2,963 CoRR structural images residing on an Amazon S3 bucket along with their corresponding PCP-QAP metrics. The demo of the CoRR dataset with PCP-QAP metrics is hosted at \url{http://mindcontrol-corr.herokuapp.com}. 

The overarching goal of the ABIDE initiative is to expedite the discovery of the neural basis of autism by providing open access to a large, heterogeneous collection of structural and functional neuroimaging datasets collected from over 23 institutions \cite{Di_Martino_2013}. The Preprocessed Connectomes Project provides cortical thickness measures of the ABIDE dataset output by the ANTs software package \cite{avants2009advanced}, along with summary statistics across regions of interests (ROIs) defined by the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) protocol \cite{Klein_2012}. The Mindcontrol database was populated with pointer URLs to S3-hosted cortical thickness images and their corresponding ROI summary measures, along with PCP-QAP metrics. The demo of the ABIDE dataset with ANTS cortical thickness and PCP-QAP metrics is located at \url{http://mindcontrol-abide.herokuapp.com}.

%In response, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) initiative has aggregated functional and structural brain imaging data collected from laboratories around the world to accelerate our understanding of the neural bases of autism. With the ultimate goal of facilitating discovery science and comparisons across samples, the ABIDE initiative now includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II.
