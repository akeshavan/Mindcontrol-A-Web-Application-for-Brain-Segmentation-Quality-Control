\subsection{Client-Side Features}
The user interface consists of a dashboard view and an imaging view, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:dashboard} and \ref{fig:imagingview}, respectively. The primary dashboard view consists of processing module sections, a query controller, data tables, and descriptive statistic visualizations. Each entry in the table is a link that, when clicked, filters all tables on the page. The filters or queries can be saved, edited, and loaded in the query controller section, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:query}.
