The editing panel on the left shows the "Painter" toolbox in yellow, where users can input brush values or use the eyedropper tool to set the value to that of a clicked label. The eraser icon sets the brush value to 0, to delete or erase voxels. In the image above, the Freesurfer segmentation is being edited by erasing the voxels missclassified as dura.
