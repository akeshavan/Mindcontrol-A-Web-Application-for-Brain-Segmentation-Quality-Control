This diagram shows the different components of the Mindcontrol application. A) The client sends information, such as annotations and edits, to the server. B) The server calls a method that updates the mongoDB backend. C) When the back-end MongoDB database changes, these changes are automatically pushed to the minimongo database on the server. D) Changes on the minimongo database automatically re-renders the view on the client. E) Users can optionally push changes to the client view via the MongoDB with Python MongoDB drivers. Drivers for C, C++, Scala, Java, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and Node.js are also available through MongoDB. F) Developers can optionally write server methods to launch and Python or command line processes that use user annotations and edits to re-process images, and update the MongoDB with new results.
