\label{fig:query}
The query controller shows the different filters that have been applied to this dataset. In this example, the exams have been filtered by institution (``Milwaukee'') and by a range of left caudate volumes (brushed from the histogram). Clicking the ``x'' next to the filter removes it, and the view updates. Queries can be saved and reloaded by providing a name in the text-entry box. ``Reset'' removes all filters to show the whole dataset.
