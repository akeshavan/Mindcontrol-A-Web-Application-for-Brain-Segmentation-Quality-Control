\label{fig:dashboard}

This figure shows the Mindcontrol layout configured to quality check Freesurfer outputs from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP). Part A shows the module navigator, which links to the different processing modules on the dashboard. Part B shows the different exams and the dates they were acquired as a heatmap, where green is more and orange is less scans collected on a given day. (For demonstration purposes, the dates depicted here do not reflect the actual dates the data were collected for the FCP, since this information was not provided at the time.) Clicking on data in any column of the exam table filters the data by that column. For example, clicking the site ``Milwaukee'' reduces both the ``Exams'' and the ``FreeSurfer'' tables to only show subjects from Milwaukee. Part C shows the Freesurfer table and regional volume distribution of the left caudate. A drop-down menu allows users to switch the descriptive metric. Clicking on a value in FreeSurfer ID column brings the user to the imaging view, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:imagingview}, where users can evaluate and annotate the quality status of the image. The value of the label in the ``QC'' column changes instantaneously due to Meteor's built in full-stack reactivity.
