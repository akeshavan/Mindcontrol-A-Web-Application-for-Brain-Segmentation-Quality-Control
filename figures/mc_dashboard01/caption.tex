\label{fig:dashboard}

This figure shows the Mindcontrol layout configured to quality check Freesurfer outputs from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP). Part A shows the module navigator, which links to the different processing modules on the dashboard. Part B shows the different exams and the dates they were acquired, as a heatmap, where green is larger and orange is smaller. For demonstration purposes, the dates depicted here do not reflect the actual dates the data were collected for the FCP, since this information was not provided at the time. Clicking on data in any of the columns of the table below filters the data by the column. For example, clicking the site ``Milwaukee'' reduces both the ``Exams'' and the ``FreeSurfer'' tables to only show subjects who were from Milwaukee. Part C shows the Freesurfer table and regional volume distribution of the left caudate. A drop down menu allows users to switch the descriptive metric. Clicking on a value in FreeSurfer ID column brings the user to the imaging view, shown in Figure \ref{fig:imagingview} where users can mark the quality status of the image. The value of the label in the ``QC'' column changes instantaneously due to Meteor's built in full-stack reactivity.
