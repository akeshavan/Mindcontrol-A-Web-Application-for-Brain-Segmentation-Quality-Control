\label{fig:brush}
This demonstrates the interactive brushing feature of Mindcontrol histograms. On the left, the user has brushed the tail end of the left caudate volume distribution from Freesurfer. On the right, the histogram has been redrawn with data from the brushed range, and the table beneath filtered from 200 entries to 14 entries based on the brushed caudate volumes.
