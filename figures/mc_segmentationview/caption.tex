The imaging view of mindcontrol consists of a left-hand panel of the QC status, a point annotation menu, a curve annotation menu, a voxel editing menu, and a QC status, notes, and editor assignment panel. On the right hand side, the base MRI anatomical MPRAGE image is displayed with an overlay of the segmentation outputs of Freesurfer, using the same colormap of Freesurfer using the papaya viewer.
