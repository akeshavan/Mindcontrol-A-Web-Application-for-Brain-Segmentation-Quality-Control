\label{fig:annotate}
The annotations panel can be used to annotate a single point (shown in red, part A) and curves (shown in B). When annotating points, the user is shown the selected x,y,z world coordinates and is able to name the annotation. In the curve annotation panel on the left sidebar, the user is able to name the curve and add/remove curves. Keyboard shortcuts: ``dd'' removes the previous annotation and ``zz'' toggles the segmentation overlay.
