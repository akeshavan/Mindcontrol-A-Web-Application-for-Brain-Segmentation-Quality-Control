The user interface, consists of a dashboard view and a imaging view, as shown in figures (insert ref) and (insert ref). The primary dashboard view consists of processing module sections, a query controller, data tables, and descriptive statistic visualizations. The processing modules are defined by the user in the JSON structure, which describes the module names and columns to display in the data table below. Each entry in the table is a link, that when clicked filters all tables on the page. The filters or queries can be saved, edited, and loaded in the query controller section shown in figure (insert ref here). Descriptive statistics are visualized using the D3 library (\href{https://d3js.org/}{https://d3js.org/}). Currently, two visualization are provided, a histogram of calendar dates that shows the number of exams collected on a given day, and 1D histograms with swappable dimensions using a dropdown, as shown in figure (insert ref). Both histogram plots interactively filter the data tables below. Clicking on a particular date on the date-histogram plot filters all tables by the exams collected on that particular date. Users are able to "brush" section of the histogram to filter all tables to with exams that meet values within that range.
