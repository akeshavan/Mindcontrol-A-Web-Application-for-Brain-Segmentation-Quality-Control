Annotations of points and curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:annotate}. Using the shift key, users may click on the image to annotate points or select the "Logged Curves" toolbar. By \textit{shift+click and dragging}, users can draw curves. Keyboard and mouse shortcuts provided by the Papaya.js viewer, along with Mindcontrol include toggling overlays (zz) and undoing annotations (dd). Figure \ref{fig:edit} shows the editing ("Painter") panel of the imaging view. Users set paintbrush values and \textit{shift+click and drag} to change voxel values. For point and curve annotations and voxel editing, the images themselves are not changed, but world x,y,z coordinates along with annotation text or paintbrush values are saved to the mongo database when the user clicks "save". Custom offline functions may be written to apply editing to images, for example, to implement pial surface edits from Freesurfer.
